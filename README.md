#### A project in the field of Robotics. Designed for the bicylcists, when you turn left or right, a gyroscope detect that extra movement and produce an audio signal and a light signal.  
#### The audio signal is made by a buzzer. The projects include a reflective vest which has 2 simple leds (1 for left, 1 for right).
