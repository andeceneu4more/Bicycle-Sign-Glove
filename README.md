# Bicycle Turning Signal   
A project in the field of Robotics. Designed for the bicylcists, when you turn left or right, a gyroscope detect that extra movement and produce an audio and a light signal.  
The audio signal is produced by a buzzer. It also includes 2 simple red leds (1 for left, 1 for right), attached on 2 clips. The clips have to be place on the shoulders of the coat:
